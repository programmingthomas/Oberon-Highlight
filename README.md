#Oberon Highlight

Syntax highlighting definitions for editors and other highlighters for Oberon-2,
based off of the subset of Oberon implemented by [Mike Spivey's
compiler](http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Oxford_Oberon-2_compiler) and the
[imperative programming course at the University of
Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2015-2016/imperativeprogramming1/index.html).

##Vim installation instructions

Copy `oberon.vim` into `~/.vim/syntax/` (you may need to make this directory).
Please note that file type detection currently doesn't work.
